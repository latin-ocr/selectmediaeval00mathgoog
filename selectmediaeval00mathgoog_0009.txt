two instanceS‚ alsa matter has been added that espe-
cially illustrates the literary rncthod ol the period, while,
on the other hand, it has not seemed necessary to give
all the donations and oaths of the Empernm, or all repe-
titions ol excommunication in thecase oi Frederich ll.

While otherwise only those Peaces and treaties have
been selected that closed an important struggle or
marked a deeided advance in the relations between the
Popes and EmperorS, the Peace ol Constance has been
added in an appendix because oi its great importance
in the history ol' the Italian citieS. ln general, hou·-

- ever, only such selections have been admitted as illus-

trate the causes and growth of the three main issues.

In addition to the works mentioned in the text arrd
in the list below‚llicl1tei·'s Arraalen der detttaehen Ge-
scltichte ira Mittelolter‚ aud the various Jaluaueter ol
the Historical Commission‚ have been of special service.

Ii the study oi these selections should arr'ahen the
desire for a better acquaintance with the Annalists of
the Middle' liges, the school edition of the Mendaeum,
the Scriptores Rerum Germanicorum, is recommended

as both critical and inexpensive. Studeuts? will find ’

great help iu a work like Dahlmann's Urhaadeabaeh
edited by Waitz.

It will be seen that most ol the selections are from
the Monumcata Gernzoaioe Historiae, J affd’s Bibliotheca
Raram Germanicorum, Huillard-Breholles' Hiatorr'ea Di-
plomariea Frederier‘ II. The text at least, therefore, is

worthy of confidence.
The compiler is greatly indebted to ΜΓ. Normau L.
